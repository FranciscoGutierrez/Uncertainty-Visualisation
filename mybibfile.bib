@article{Paolacci2010,
abstract = {Although Mechanical Turk has recently become popular among social scientists as a source of experimental data, doubts may linger about the quality of data provided by subjects recruited from online labor markets. We address these potential concerns by presenting new demographic data about the Mechanical Turk subject population, reviewing the strengths of Mechanical Turk relative to other online and offline methods of recruiting subjects, and comparing the magnitude of effects obtained using Mechanical Turk and traditional subject pools. We further discuss some additional benefits such as the possibility of longitudinal, cross cultural and prescreening designs, and offer some advice on how to best manage a common subject pool.},

        abstract = {Error and uncertainty in remotely sensed data come from several sources, and can be increased or mitigated by the processing to which that data is subjected (e.g. resampling, atmospheric correction). Historically the effects of such uncertainty have only been considered overall and evaluated in a confusion matrix which becomes high-level meta-data, and so is commonly ignored. However, some of the sources of uncertainty can be explicitly identified and modelled, and their effects (which often vary across space and time) visualized. Others can be considered overall, but their spatial effects can still be visualized. This process of visualization is of particular value for users who need to assess the importance of data uncertainty for their own practical applications. This paper describes a Java-based toolkit, which uses interactive and linked views to enable visualization of data uncertainty by a variety of means. This allows users to consider error and uncertainty as integral elements of image data, to be viewed and explored, rather than as labels or indices attached to the data.},

The uncertainties present in data come with many diverse representations having originated from a wide variety of disciplines. Communicating these uncertainties is a task often left to visualization without clear connection between the quantification and visualization. In this paper, we first identify frequently occurring types of uncertainty. Second, we connect those uncertainty representations to ones commonly used in visualization. We then look at various approaches to visualizing this uncertainty by partitioning the work based on the dimensionality of the data and the dimensionality of the uncertainty. We also discuss noteworthy exceptions to our taxonomy along with future research directions for the uncertainty visualization community.},

We identify and illustrate the uncertainty of the exurban concept using a fuzzy-set based conceptual space approach. Several definitions of exurbanization are investigated on how they conceptualize exurban areas and we develop formal representations for our analysis and demonstration. To support this we develop a software interface that would allow interactive exploration, analysis, negotiation, and visualization of uncertain geospatial concepts. With selected definitions applied to empirical spatial data we demonstrate some key features of the developed software, such as concept comparison and concept creation activities. The case study of five different definitions of exurbanization in north-central Ohio, \{US\} shows varying degrees of agreement and illustrates the impact of different approaches to negotiate the multiple different definitions. The paper also provides the results from user-evaluation of the developed software to better support the exchange of knowledge and communication between the users.},

Change was judged more quickly and accurately with line and bar graphs than with pie charts or tiered bar graphs, and this difference was larger when the rate of change was smaller. Without a graduated scale, proportion was judged more quickly and accurately with pie charts and divided bar graphs than with line or bar graphs. Perception is direct when it requires simpler or fewer mental operations; we propose that perception of change is direct with line and bar graphs, whereas perception of proportion is direct with pie charts and divided bar graphs. The results are also consistent with the proximity compatibility principle. Suggestions for improving the design of graphical displays are given.},
